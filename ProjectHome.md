Inspired by the need to solve the chaotic mess caused by having individual applications decide their own file-storage semantics and of having developers under time pressure resort to failure-prone tactics like using persistent filesystem connections and arbitrary database lookup methods to establish ownership, the media-storage project seeks to make it easy for IT departments to provide one or more communal file-storage targets (for small units of data) that can be programmatically accessed and queried with simple, human-readable semantics.

Unlike other tagged filesystem projects, media-storage is targeted solely at API consumers and, while it may offer an operator interface, it is not suitable for use by end-users, or for local filesystem management (due to the overhead of its protocol, needed to allow it to serve as a shared resource).

The media-storage system is a stateless, meta-data-oriented means of managing single files that must be shared acros multiple hosts. Its primary venue is for small-to-medium-sized operations that manage a large number of discrete entities (documents, voice recordings, images) that are stored for some period of time and that may be retrieved repeatedly by other applications in the environment.


Note for later docs: FUSE is preferable over implementing support for unusual filesystems, since it has semantics for auto-recovery that would be hard to implement in a generalised way.
